## Solution

I opened the provided document in Google Docs. I tried searching for the words "flag" or "DUCTF,"
but came up empty handed. There wasn't anything unusual about the document's metadata, and there
didn't seem to be any files hidden inside of the document. I returned to the document and selected
all of the content with Ctrl+A. This revealed some very small text on the 3rd page with the same
color as the background. That text can be found here. Running the given commands revealed the flag.
You can see the command output here.

flag: DUCTF{chatgpt_I_n33d_2_3scap3}
